## Description
Garry's Mod Lua project aimed at expanding the game's functionality and improving performance.

The project includes a package manager and supports many third-party APIs. The framework itself greatly expands the capabilities of developers for designing complex and comprehensive systems and games based on Garry's Mod.

After many years of hard work I can finally say that we have created a trully powerful runtime for developers ;>
