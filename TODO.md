### Release to-do list
- [ ] Finish custom Lua transport implementation
- [ ] Packages auto-reload
- [ ] Server-side CLI commands ( install, remove, reload and etc. )
- [ ] Write a new NetTransfer class to transfer large amounts of data over `net`
- [ ] NetTables - synchronizable tables, support only basic Lua types ( strings, numbers, booleans, tables, maybe vectors, colors and angles )
- [ ] Write tests for all functionality ( we will die trying )
- [ ] Write documentation

### Know issues
- [ ] For some unknown reason server packages for some people go into an infinite dependency wait without any errors
